Factors xthat affect landing:

Position
Y velocity
angle


X velocity 
Angular velocity (rotation speed)
Angular direction (rotation direction)
Ground angle
Ground friction



Rotational forces:
	user input
	contact with ground/ramp

Important: Until flat, bike is in freefall

Angular velocity of bike upon single-wheel ground contact should not change yVel.

Should angular velocity change upon single wheel contact?

Should angular velocity affect which direction the bike tilts when it comes into contact with the ground (how it lands)?
